| TEST 40: Testing a configuration requiring the building of different structures to win.
|
| In order to test this, please build one of each available buildings. Deleting some before winning would be a nice test as well. The game should be complete afterwards. 
| It's worth noting as well that building more than what is required of a type is allowed and does not halt the game.
