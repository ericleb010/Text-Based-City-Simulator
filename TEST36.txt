| TEST 36: Testing a configuration with a building type available.
|
| There should be a building that shows up below, with its long-form / short-form name, utility usage, and price.
| Now you can build stuff! As explained in the help files, the command is "build <type> <parentID>". To remove, it's "remove <ID>"!
|
| Notice that the cash available to you decreases as well.
